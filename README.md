We have built this repository to house all the materials for the R sessions. You will be able to access the csv file, the R scripts for the individual R sessions, and the links to the R session recordings.

Datasets: OldLOL.csv is for R sessions up through 10/10/2021. Once you reach Time Series, the dataset switches to LOL.csv
